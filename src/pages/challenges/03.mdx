## 🐇 TL;DR

- Our code works, but is not re-usable
- We're working in multiple files
- Let's consolidate this into a **Tailwind CSS plugin**!

## 🐢 Background

We've laid the foundations of our theming strategy. But we can probably improve our developer experience here.

We’re defining our CSS variables **in a CSS file**. And we're generating new color utilities **in the Tailwind config** file.

That would be nice if we could do **both things within the same file**.

What if we want to support theming in another project using Tailwind CSS? Do we repeat this process for each new project?

Surely there must be a better way.

### The Tailwind Plugin API

And that’s the Tailwind Plugin API.

Tailwind CSS offers a powerful Plugin API that lets you author CSS with the **full power of JavaScript**. It also allows you to **reuse functionality across projects**.

This will allow us to do all our theming work in one place, too!

Here's the relevant page from the [Tailwind CSS documentation website](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins).

Before we port over our theming strategy, let's build a super simple "Hello World" plugin. Just to verify that it works.

## 🏆 Your challenge 🏆

In the Tailwind Play below:

1. In the JS tab, require the `plugin` function from `tailwindcss/plugin`.

2. Use that function to create a simple plugin that generates the following CSS:

   ```css
   body {
     text-transform: uppercase;
   }
   ```

   You'll need to write your CSS using the [CSS-in-JS object syntax](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#css-in-js-syntax)!

✌️ Good luck!
