import ButtonLink from '../../components/ButtonLink.astro'

## 🐇 TL;DR

- Our plugin is not exactly dynamic yet
- We're still hardcoding the `50` to `900` color shade keys
- But hey, this is a start!
- Before we continue, let's make sure our plugin **takes care of all the moving parts**

## 🐢 Background

Our plugin is starting to look good!

Before we continue making our code more dynamic, we should make sure our plugin takes care of handling all the moving parts of our theming functionality.

We're generating the CSS variables from the plugin, but we're still creating new color utilities from our config file.

It might be a bit confusing since we're working in one single file in Tailwind Play. Our plugin code would probably live in a different file in a real project directory.

### We can extend the user's theme directly from within the plugin

The `plugin` function we're using to create our plugin can accept **a second argument**, which is a `config` object.

That means we can extend or override our Tailwind theme directly from within the plugin, instead of doing it manually in the config as we're currently doing!

## 🏆 Your challenge 🏆

In the Tailwind Play below:

1. In the Config tab, move the code extending the `theme` object outside of the Tailwind config, and put it inside the `plugin` function instead.

This is a quick and easy code change, but a significant milestone for our plugin!

✌️ Good luck!
