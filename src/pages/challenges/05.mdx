## üêá TL;DR

- We moved out CSS variables to the plugin
- The `R` `G` `B` format we're using is a bit uncommon
- Our original color themes were using `HEX` values
- Let's use JavaScript to convert `HEX` colors to the desired `R` `G` `B` format!

## üê¢ Background

We've moved our CSS variable declarations from the CSS file to the plugin. This is great, we're now doing all our work in the same file - and in the same language!

Looking at our code, it's kinda odd that we're defining the CSS variables with this `R` `G` `B` channels format. It's... uncommon.

We want our plugin to end up being reusable without much manual work. And converting the colors to `R` `G` `B` channels sounds like manual work!

Remember our initial color themes objects we started the workshop with? Click below to show the code snippet.

Those were using **`HEX` color values**.

It will be much more common to deal with `HEX` colors than our custom `R` `G` `B` format.

For example, if someone was to import the color palette from Tailwind CSS (via `tailwindcss/colors`), they'd get... `HEX` values.

Let's assume our plugin should take `HEX` colors as an input. Since we're now working in JavaScript, we can write some code to transform `HEX` values into our desired, custom `R` `G` `B` format.

We could probably do this from scratch, but there's a [little library by Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hex-rgb) called [hex-rbg](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hex-rgb) that I really like.

As the name suggest, it converts `HEX` colors to useful `RGB` formats.

Let's use that to create a little helper function that takes a `HEX` value, and returns our desired `R` `G` `B` string:

```js
const hexRgb = require('hex-rgb')

function getRgbChannels(hex) {
  const { red, green, blue } = hexRgb(hex)
  return `${red} ${green} ${blue}`
}
```

If we were to call that function with the `#0099aa` `HEX` color, here's what we'd get:

```js
getRgbChannels('#0099aa') => 0 153 170
```

Perfect!

We can use this function to transform the `HEX` values from our color themes object.

## üèÜ Your challenge üèÜ

In the Tailwind Play below:

1. In the Config tab, Use the `getRgbChannels` helper function to transform the `HEX` values from the `themes` object.

You know the drill - code duplication is still okay for now üòÖ

‚úåÔ∏è Good luck!
