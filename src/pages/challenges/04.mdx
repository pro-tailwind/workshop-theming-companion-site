- Let's port our CSS variables to the plugin!

## 🐢 Background

Now that we have our Tailwind CSS plugin wired up, let's start consolidating our theming functionality into the plugin.

The first thing we want to do is **port the CSS variable declarations** from the CSS file to the plugin.

That means we'll be able to do **all our work in one file** - and one language!

## 🏆 Your challenge 🏆

In the Tailwind Play below:

1. Move the CSS variable declarations from the CSS tab to the plugin defined in the Config tab.

You'll need to write your CSS using the [CSS-in-JS object syntax](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#css-in-js-syntax)!

One more time, resist worrying about code duplication for now 😅

✌️ Good luck!
