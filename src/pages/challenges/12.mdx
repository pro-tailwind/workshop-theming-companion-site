## üêá TL;DR

- We did it - we built a reusable multi-theme Tailwind CSS plugin üéâ
- **You** did it, and you have now acquired a new **Tailwind superpower** ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
- What would you do next?

## üß† What would you do next?

Now that you understand the key moving parts of building multi-theme support in Tailwind CSS, you can probably see how the same approach could be extented further.

How about branching off colors and adding different `rounded corners`, `shadows` or `font families` for each theme?

Our current plugin only supports working the `colors` object, but I am usre you ca imagine how instead of passing _just_ color objects, we could pass objects that extend/update multiple of Tailwind's `corePlugins` like `borderRadius`, `shadow` or `fontFamily`...

The core concepts underlying that approach remain the same: define CSS variables holiding specific values at the `root` scope, and redefine those variables within theme-specific scopes.

And the Tailwind CSS Plugin API gives you all the power you need to handle everything your mind can think of!
