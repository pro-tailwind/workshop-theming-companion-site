## 🐇 TL;DR

- We've got more work to do, but...
- I say it's time we **test our plugin in an existing Tailwind CSS project**!
- Let's add our color themes to the Calendar App 🎉

## 🏆 Your challenge 🏆

For this one, we're going to spin up an instance of the Calendar App via Gitpod.

You can also clone the repo locally, if you want to play with it after the workshop.

Let's do this one together, as a group. I'll drive and share my screen, but feel free to ask questions and ask me to poke around!
