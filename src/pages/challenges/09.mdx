## üêá TL;DR

- Let's stop **hard coding** `primary` color shades, and read values from the color themes instead.
- We should support multi-level, nested color objects!

## üê¢ Background

Up to this point, we've been _assuming_ that we want to generate a `primary` color with `50` to `900` shades.

This assumption makes our plugin very "rigid", and we cannot pretend this code is truly reusable.

What we need to do next is generate our CSS variables and color utilities based on what the `themes` actually contain.

We want to support multi-level color objects, where nested properties generate "kebab-case" utilities.

Take the following theme object for the `base` theme:

```js
const themes = {
  base: {
    primary: {
      50: '#eef2ff',
      100: '#e0e7ff',
      200: '#d0d7f7',
      300: '#aab9ff',
      400: '#8994ff',
      500: '#6b70fc',
      600: '#554fee',
      700: '#453ccd',
      800: '#3830a2',
      900: '#272173',
    },
    secondary: {
      some: {
        nested: {
          color: '#0099aa',
        },
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
}
```

Here, we explicitely ask for `primary-50` to `primary-900` colors within the `primary` key.

But we also demand a `secondary` key, with a "deep nested" color property.

Nested properties should generate `kebab-case` color keys, so in that case, here's what CSS variable we should expect for the `secondary` color:

```js
'--secondary-some-nested-color': getRgbChannels('#0099aa')
```

And the matching counterpart, where we extend the `colors` theme object in the config, should look like that:

```js
secondary: {
  some: {
    nested: {
      color: 'rgb(var(--secondary-some-nested-color) / <alpha-value>)'
    }
  }
}
```

Generating these CSS variables and theme extension objects dynamically based on the "input" would make our plugin infinitely more reusable and versatile.

And we can use JavaScript to do this!

## üèÜ Your challenge üèÜ

In the Tailwind Play below:

1. Write a JavaScript function that _traverses_ a given object input, and generates the appropriate kebab-cased CSS variables.

   Use that function to replace the "hardcoded" `primary-50` to `primary-900` CSS variables currently in place.

2. Write a similar function that generates the appropriate **colors extension object**, and use that to replace the hardcoded `primary` object currently extending the color theme in the `config`.

You'll find more hints within the Play.

‚úåÔ∏è Good luck!
