## 🐇 TL;DR

- We're using values directly from the `themes` object
- We're transforming `HEX` values to our `R` `G` `B` format requirement
- Things are taking shape!
- Let's remove a _little bit_ of duplication before we continue

## 🐢 Background

We've just removed a manual step by making our plugin accept `HEX` values.

In the process, we've also started reading the color values directly from the `themes` object, which is a big step towards making our plugin reusable and flexible.

Before we continue, let's make our code a bit smaller and more dynamic with a simple refactoring task.

## 🏆 Your challenge 🏆

In the Tailwind Play below:

1. In the Config tab, iterate over the `themes` object to dynamically generate the theme-specific `[data-theme=""]` CSS blocks for each theme.

You'll find more hints within the Play.

✌️ Good luck!
