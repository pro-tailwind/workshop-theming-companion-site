## üêá TL;DR

- We added themable colors that change fron theme to theme, but...
- We `borked` the color opacity support in the process üò≠
- We need to **compose Tailwind's internal opacity CSS variable** within our themable colors

## üê¢ Background

When implementing our themable colors, we‚Äôve accidentally thrown away an important feature of Tailwind CSS: **Color Opacity management**.

Oh no! üôÄ

## How Tailwind CSS handles opacity

You may not even have thought about this, but there are no such properties as `text-opacity` or `background-opacity` in CSS.

Yet, Tailwind CSS still provides `text-opacity` and `bg-opacity` utility classes that work flawlessly.

**How?**

Let‚Äôs take a look at a `background-color` class for a default Tailwind CSS color, like `bg-indigo-600` for example:

```html
<p class="bg-indigo-600">I love this color</p>
```

Here's the CSS generated for this utility class:

```css
.bg-indigo-600 {
  --tw-bg-opacity: 1;
  background-color: rgb(79 70 229 / var(--tw-bg-opacity));
}
```

See that `--tw-bg-opacity` CSS variable? It's being used to _compose_ the opacity into the background color, which is defined as an `rgb()` color.

Nice!

---

## CSS variable composition

By default, this opacity variable is set to `1`, or full opacity.

Let's add a background opacity utilty to our paragraph tag:

```html
<p class="bg-indigo-600 bg-opacity-50">I love this color</p>
```

Can you guess what that `bg-opacity-50` class is doing?

---

<Reveal client:load title="the generated CSS">
```css
.bg-opacity-50 {
  --tw-bg-opacity: 0.5;
}
```
</Reveal>

---

That's right. It just _redefines_ the value of the `--tw-bg-opacity` variable. It doesn't apply any CSS property or anything!

Since the opacity utilities are generated _after_ the color utilities in the CSS file, the value of the `--tw-bg-opacity` CSS variable is updated to `0.5`.

As a result, the background color is now a `rgb()` color with a `0.5` alpha channel, or 50% opacity!

```diff
.bg-indigo-600 {
-  --tw-bg-opacity: 1;
+  --tw-bg-opacity: 0.5;
  background-color: rgb(79 70 229 / var(--tw-bg-opacity));
}
```

This is some pretty clever stuff, hopefully opening your eyes to what you can do with CSS variable composition.

Tailwind CSS is full of mind bending CSS variable composition tricks.

## Tailwind CSS internally transform colors to RGB

While Tailwind CSS is capable of working its internal magic to transform different color formats like HEX, RGB or HSL, it‚Äôs **not able to do that** when we **define colors as CSS variables**, as we currently do:

```js
theme: {
    extend: {
        textColors: {
            base: 'var(--color-text-base)',
            inverted: 'var(--color-text-inverted)',
        }
    }
}
```

When using CSS variables, here's what CSS a similar background color utility would generate.

The following utility class...

```html
<p class="bg-primary-600">I love this color</p>
```

... would generate this CSS:

```css
.bg-primary-600 {
  background-color: var(--primary-600);
}
```

No opacity composition anywhere.

It‚Äôs just using the CSS variable we‚Äôve passed to it.

Adding a background opacity would do nothing, since it just updates the `--tw-bg-opacity` variable... which is never used in our `bg-primary-600` class.

In other words, we‚Äôre stuck with using full opacity colors only with our current implementation.

That‚Äôs a bummer!

### `<alpha-value>` to the rescue

Luckily, Tailwind gives us access to it's internal `<alpha-value>`, which we can use to compose our own `rgb()` colors when consuming CSS variables.

This is what you'll need to do in this challenge!
