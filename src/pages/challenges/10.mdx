## üêá TL;DR

- The last "hardcoded" thing is how the color themes are made available to the plugin
- Let's allow users to define their own color themes in the Tailwind config!

## üê¢ Background

Whoaaa. At this point, our plugin is pretty badass.

The one weird thing remaning is how the color themes are made available to the plugin. Right now, we're defining those themes _inside_ the plugin.

It would be way more useful to allow users of our plugin to define the themes themselves, and make our plugin accept that data.

We can do this in a couple of different ways, and we'll start by doing it via a custom Tailwind config theme key.

### Adding a custom key to our Tailwind config

In our Tailwind config's `theme` object, we can create a new key, which we'll be able to read from within the plugin.

Since our plugin is called `multiTheme`, how about creating a `multiTheme` key in our `theme` object in the config?

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // We can define a custom theme key for our color themes
    multiTheme: {
      base: {
        primary: { ... },
        secondary: {... }
      },
      rainforest: { ... },
      candy: { ... }
    },
  },
}
```

We'll be able to access this key anwyere where Tailwind's `theme()` function works.

News flash - it's almost everywhere. You can use it in your `CSS`, in your `HTML` and...

...in `JavaScript` with the Plugin API!

To read a theme value within a plugin, you can use the `theme` function available inside the `plugin()` function:

```js
plugin(function ({ addbase, theme }) {
  const colorThemes = theme('multiTheme')
  addBase({
    // ...
  })
})
```

## üèÜ Your challenge üèÜ

In the Tailwind Play below...

1. Move the color themes definition into a custom key inside the Tailwind config's theme.

2. Update the plugin code to read the color theme values from the config file instead.
