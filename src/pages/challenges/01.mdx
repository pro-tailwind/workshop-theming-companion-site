## üêá TL;DR

- We're currently **not** doing any theming with our extended colors
- Let's **define these colors as CSS variables**, so they can change from theme to theme!

## üê¢ Background

As we just noted, our current implementation of extra colors has nothing to do with **theming**.

Right now, we're just defining three new colors in our Tailwind config:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
const themes = {...}

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        base: themes.base.colors,
        rainforest: themes.rainforest.colors,
        candy: themes.candy.colors,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

**There is no theming happeneing at all here**. We've just extended our theme with new colors.

Each color is generating new, different utility classes. Like `bg-rainforest-500`, or `text-candy-800`.

Those colors have a "hardcoded" value baked in their name. _One_ specific value.

What we want is to be able to **use the same color utility class across all themes**.

We need a name that _makes sesnse_ regardless of what color that utility class represents. A _semantic_ color name.

We should be able to **redefine that color** based on the currently active theme.

To do this, let's leverage the power of **CSS custom properties**, or CSS variables.

## üèÜ Your first challenge üèÜ

In the Tailwind Play below, implement a `primary-500` color that works across all themes.

Here are a few steps to guide you:

1. In the CSS tab, **define a `--primary-500` CSS variable**. Do this at the `:root` scope.

2. In the Config tab, extend the `colors` object with a new `primary` color, with a `500` shade that uses the `--primar-500` CSS variable.

3. Redefine this variables within **theme scopes**. You'll need to work out _what_ those scope selectors should be!

4. Extra üå∂: If you got it working, repeat the process for the rest of the `50` to `900` shades.

**Don't worry about code duplication** for now. Let's start by making it work. Copy & paste like there is no tomorrow!

You'll find more hints within the Play.
